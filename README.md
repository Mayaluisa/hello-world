## I am a fellow at The Marcy Lab School. 

I enjoy practicing writing **code**. 
Please view the **function** below: 

```const greet = (name) =>{
    console.log (`Hello, ${name}``)
}
console.log(greet(Reader))
```
We make sure to plan our days and work with Google Calendar. This allows the class to stay on track with our work. 

*See you tomorrow!*
